# This is my terminal project in React

This is the code for the terminal component used in my personal website. 
My hope for this project is to extend it until it can fully emulate a terminal (or to have as many features as possible).
My end goal is to have it be published as a package to npm, so that it can be used and imported by other
people into their projects.

Things to add:
- [ ] Add ability to cd deeper than one level and go back up
- [ ] Auto complete with tabs
- [ ] edit text files with vi
- [ ] create text files 
- [ ] create folders
- [ ] user customizability (change name of terminal, initialize with custom files)
- [ ] ability to close, minimize, and expand terminal to full screen 
- [ ] resize window by stretching it
